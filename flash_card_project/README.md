# Flashy Flashcards 💡🎴

**Flashy** is a dynamic flashcard learning app designed to help you learn French vocabulary with ease! 🚀

## Project Overview 📚

This project is built using **Python** and leverages the **Tkinter** library for creating a user-friendly graphical interface. The flashcards display a random French word, and with a simple flip, you can reveal its English translation. It’s a fun and interactive way to expand your language skills! 🇫🇷➡️🇬🇧

## Features 🎨

- 🗣️ **Learn French Vocabulary**: Randomly generated French words are displayed on a flashcard.
- 🔄 **Card Flipping**: Easily flip the card to reveal the English translation.
- ✅ **Progress Tracking**: Mark words as "known," and they will be removed from your study list, ensuring you focus on words that need more practice.
- 💾 **Persistent Data**: Your progress is saved in a CSV file, so you can pick up right where you left off.

## Programming Language and Libraries 🛠️

- **Python**: The core language used for building the app.
- **Tkinter**: Used for creating the GUI (Graphical User Interface).
- **Pandas**: Utilized for handling CSV files, allowing easy data management and manipulation.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Random Word Selection**: On each run, the app selects a random French word from a CSV file.
2. **Card Flipping**: The app displays the word in French, and after 3 seconds, it automatically flips to show the English translation.
3. **Progress Tracking**: If you mark a word as known, it's removed from your study list and saved in a separate CSV file.
