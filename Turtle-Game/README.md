# Traffic Dodger 🚗🏃‍♂️

**Traffic Dodger** is a fun and challenging arcade game where you must guide your character across the road, dodging speeding obstacles and leveling up as you progress! 🎮

## Project Overview 📚

This project is developed using **Python** and the **Turtle** graphics library. The player controls a character that moves upwards across the screen, avoiding randomly generated obstacles. As you reach the top of the screen, you advance to the next level, where the obstacles move faster, making the game more challenging. 🚀

## Features 🎨

- 🕹️ **Interactive Gameplay**: Use the arrow keys to move your character and dodge the obstacles.
- 🏎️ **Obstacles**: Randomly generated rectangle shaped obstacles add excitement and difficulty to each level.
- 📈 **Level Progression**: Successfully crossing the road increases the difficulty by speeding up the obstacles.
- ⚠️ **Collision Detection**: If you hit an obstacle, the game ends, and your score is displayed.

## Programming Language and Libraries 🛠️

- **Python**: The core language used to build the game.
- **Turtle**: A Python library used for creating graphics and handling user interactions in the game.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Move the Player**: The player uses the "Up" arrow key to move the character up the screen.
2. **Dodge the obstacles**: obstacles appear at random intervals, and the player must avoid them to stay in the game.
3. **Level Up**: Reach the top of the screen to advance to the next level, where the obstacles move faster.
4. **Game Over**: The game ends if the player collides with an obstacle, displaying the final level achieved.
