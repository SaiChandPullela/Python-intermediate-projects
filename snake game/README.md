# üêç Snake Game

Welcome to the classic **Snake Game** implemented using Python's Turtle graphics! üêçüéÆ

## Project Overview

In this game, you control a snake that grows longer each time it eats food. The objective is to avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own body while trying to achieve the highest possible score. The game is implemented using Python's Turtle module, which provides a simple way to create graphics and manage user input.

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay**: Navigate the snake using arrow keys.
- **Score Tracking**: Score increases each time the snake eats food.
- **Collision Detection**: Game restarts if the snake collides with walls or itself.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: The game speeds up as the snake grows longer.

## How It Works

1. **Setup**: The game initializes the screen, snake, food, and scoreboard.
2. **Controls**: Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
3. **Game Loop**: The game continuously updates the screen and checks for collisions.
4. **Scoring**: Each food item eaten increases the snake's length and score.
5. **Restart**: The game resets if the snake collides with the screen edges or itself.
