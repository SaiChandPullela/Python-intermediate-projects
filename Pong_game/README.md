# Pong Game 🎮🏓

Welcome to the Pong game! 🚀 This project is a classic Pong game built using Python's Turtle graphics library. 🐢

## 🕹️ **Features**
- **Two Player Mode**: Control paddles using keyboard inputs: 
  - Player 1: `W` and `S` keys
  - Player 2: `Up` and `Down` arrow keys
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: The ball bounces off the paddles and walls. 🏓
- **Scoring System**: Points are awarded when the ball passes a paddle, and the score is updated accordingly. 📈
- **Speed Adjustment**: The game speeds up slightly each time the ball hits a paddle. ⚡

## 🛠️ **How It Works**
- **Paddles**: Controlled by user inputs, they move up and down to hit the ball.
- **Ball**: Moves across the screen, bouncing off paddles and walls.
- **Scoreboard**: Keeps track of points and displays the score.

2. Run `pong.py` in your Python environment.
